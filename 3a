# Step 1: Load and clean data
df = pd.read_csv('breast_cancer.csv')
df = df.iloc[:, :-1]   # Drop last column if it's irrelevant

# Step 2: Define features (X) and target (y)
X = df.iloc[:, 2:].values   # Selecting features from 3rd column onwards
y = df['diagnosis'].values  # Target column

# Step 3: Split data (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Train Decision Tree model

model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 5: Evaluate model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
